<h2>About</h2>

This repository contains implementation in C++ of mathematical methods such as: Quaternions, Fourier Transformation, Finite Element Method ... for scientific computing / numerical simulation. Numerical simulation became very useful in many fiedls, Fluid Mechanics, Climate Change, Biology ...
Algorithms are implemented through (C++) generic programming techniques.
